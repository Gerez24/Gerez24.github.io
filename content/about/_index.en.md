# Who are we?

AnimeEffects was originally developed by Japanese artist and programmer Hidefuku, the app during its development gained a lot of traction for being an easy and open source way to do 2D animation, unfortunately however in April 2017 Hidefuku would make his last known commit to the repository, after which they completely vanished from the internet.

In 2019 a group of artists and developers picked up this project to bring further improvements to it and to hopefully keep this amazing project alive, and here we are now!

Here are the people that have helped this project in one way or another.
